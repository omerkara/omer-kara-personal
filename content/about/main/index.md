## Options.
number_categories: 4 ## Set 0 to exclude all categories (pulling from mainSections argument in config.toml file).
number_featured: 2 ## Number of featured content per category (pulling from mainSections argument in config.toml file).
use_featured: false ## If false, use most recent by date. If true, then it filters based on a "featured: true" flag added to the YAML of individual content pages.
### Note that number_categories argument is not working properly so you have to change it using mainSections argument in config.toml file.
