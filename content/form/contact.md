    I also love hearing if my <a href="https://akademiekonometri.netlify.app/courses/">educational materials</a> (mostly in Turkish) have been helpful for you, and how they could be improved — particularly if they could be made more accessible and convertable.

** Contact page doesn't contain a body, just the front matter above. See form.html in the layouts folder.
Formspree requires a (free) account and new form to be set up. The link is made on the final published url in the field: Restrict to Domain. It is possible to register up to 2 emails free and you can select which one you want the forms to go to within Formspree in the Settings tab.
