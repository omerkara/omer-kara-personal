## Details
I am currently employed at CHS Inc. as a Software Developer consultant. My primary focus is on building a shiny web app, the Crack Spread Platform, which allows end-users to perform crack spread calculations on demand. The app is interactive and dynamic, allowing users to change input specifications and then visualize the most recent results available.

The Crack Spread Platform has three important features that make it valuable to users.
- It allows users to interactively modify input values for crack spread calculations.
- The platform enables users to perform crack spread calculations for previous months spanning 10-15 years, and for current and future months for the next 2 years.
- Users can also see basis prices and spot crack spread for previous months and for current and future months.

During the development of the app, I use a range of statistical, econometric, and coding tools such as ETL, EDA, HTML, CSS, Azure DevOps, and Git. The Crack Spread Platform is built using R and R Markdown with the shiny package to provide an interactive and reproducible app.

Currently, the Crack Spread Platform is still in its building phase. I will share some snapshots from the app when possible.
