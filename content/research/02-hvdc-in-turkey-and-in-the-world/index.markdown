## Details
In this paper, we provide an economic and technical review of **High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)** transmission systems, with a particular focus on their potential role in **Turkey’s** energy system. We trace the historical development of AC and DC transmission technologies and show how HVDC has become a preferred option for long-distance, high-capacity transmission. Drawing on international experience, we summarize the main technological, economic, and environmental advantages of HVDC over conventional HVAC lines, such as lower transmission losses, higher controllability of power flows, and a smaller environmental footprint, while also noting key disadvantages like the high upfront cost of converter stations and the complexity of control systems.

In the second part of the study, we link these technological features to Turkey’s macroeconomic context of rising electricity demand and high foreign energy dependence. We review the global deployment of HVDC projects, provide a comparative assessment of investment costs using an illustrative case from **Germany**, and discuss how wider adoption of HVDC could support energy efficiency, external balance, and energy-supply security in Turkey. The paper argues that HVDC has the potential not only to increase the efficiency of domestic transmission, but also to strengthen Turkey’s position as a regional electricity hub through deeper interconnections with neighboring countries and the **European Union**.
