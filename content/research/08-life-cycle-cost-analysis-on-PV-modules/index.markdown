## Details
In this study, we conduct a localized **life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA)** of residential photovoltaic (PV) modules in Türkiye, using the city of **Eskisehir** as a case study. We model a typical **3 kW rooftop PV system** over a 30-year horizon and track all relevant cash flows: installation, maintenance, taxes, mortgage payments, and interactions with the grid under current Turkish policies such as net metering and Feed-in Tariffs. Building on an earlier 2013 household survey and updated national data from TurkStat and the Central Bank, we embed realistic assumptions on electricity prices, inflation, discount rates, and solar resource quality to answer a central question: is a residential PV investment financially rational for an average household in Eskisehir?

Our results show that, despite high upfront costs, PV systems are economically viable under today’s conditions. In the **business-as-usual scenario**, a 3 kW system generates about **€883.75 in Net Present Value (NPV) savings** over 30 years, with outcomes ranging from a modest loss (around −€392) in a pessimistic policy setting to roughly **€2350** in an optimistic scenario with stronger incentives and cheaper technology. At the same time, the system avoids more than **40 tons of CO₂** emissions over its lifetime, supporting Türkiye’s climate and energy-security objectives. We conclude that residential PV can be a rational long-term investment, but its success depends heavily on stable policy support—particularly Feed-in Tariffs or premiums, tax incentives, and accessible financing that lower effective costs and reduce risk for households.
